# Developing a Textile Bend Sensor
## MOTIVATION
Textile sensors are playing an effective role to make human interaction with computer systems more and more effortless. In this DIY project, one attempt of making a textile bend sensor is made, which can detect the amount bending or pressure. The important thing here is, it can be fixed on clothes very easily and effectively.
## OBJECTIVES
The aim of the project is to make a textile bend sensor which can detect bending and pressure as well. The sensor will be made by using cost effective materials.
## Working Principle
The principle used to make this sensor is that ‘The Velostat allows more electricity to pass through as the harder you press the two conductive layers together, with the Velostat in between.’
  1. When the sensor is bent, it exerts pressure on velostate which is placed in between Neoprene strips.
  2. Because of the pressure, the Velostat allows more current to pass through.
  3. As more current will be able to pass through, there is a decrement in the Resistance of the sensor.
  4. More bending of the sensor will result in more decrement in the Resistance of the sensor.
