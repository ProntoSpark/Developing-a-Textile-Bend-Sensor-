# Developing a Textile Bend Sensor
## MOTIVATION
Textile sensors are playing an effective role to make human interaction with computer systems more and more effortless. In this DIY project, one attempt of making a textile bend sensor is made, which can detect the amount bending or pressure. The important thing here is, it can be fixed on clothes very easily and effectively.
## OBJECTIVES
The aim of the project is to make a textile bend sensor which can detect bending and pressure as well. The sensor will be made by using cost effective materials.
## Working Principle
The principle used to make this sensor is that ‘The Velostat allows more electricity to pass through as the harder you press the two conductive layers together, with the Velostat in between.’
  1. When the sensor is bent, it exerts pressure on velostate which is placed in between Neoprene strips.
  2. Because of the pressure, the Velostat allows more current to pass through.
  3. As more current will be able to pass through, there is a decrement in the Resistance of the sensor.
  4. More bending of the sensor will result in more decrement in the Resistance of the sensor.
## bird's-eye view of the Development of the Sensor
 #### Step 1: Cut 2 Neoprene(120 mm X 12 mm ), 2 Conductive Fabric(15 mm X 9 mm) and 2 Velostate(100 mm X 11 mm).
 #### Step 2: Stitch Neoprene in a Zig-Zag pattern(should be same on both strips of Neoprene) by using conductive thread.
 #### Step 3: Stitch Conductive fabric by normal thread at the end of Neoprene strips to make terminals of the sensor.
 #### Step 4: Velostat will be placed in between two neoprene strips which are stitched already.
 #### Step 5: After that sensor will be stitched together around the outer periphery by normal thread.

## Guideline
You see three folders :
 #### 1. Current Status: you will find ‘Gantt Chart’ and ‘Current status’ files in this folder.
 #### 2. List of Material: you will find the ‘list of material’ file in this folder.
 #### 3. Resources: you will find three sub-folders here.
 ##### a. Fabrication Images: you will find images which were taken during intermediate stages of making a sensor.
 ##### b. Project Overview: it contains ‘pdf file of ‘Project Overview ppt’ and video of the same presentation.
 ##### c. Prototypes: it contains ‘Low_Fi_Prototype_design’ which shows the internal design of the sensor.
 ##### d. Sketches: it contains sketches that show example applications, parts of the sensor and their assembly design.
